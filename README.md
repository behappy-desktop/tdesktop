## What this is

BeHappy Desktop is the official desktop client for the BeHappy
messenger. It is built on top of the Telegram Desktop codebase
([tdesktop][tdesktop]) under GPL v3, with the following high-level
modifications:

- Networking layer rewritten to use the **MVSy 1.0** protocol and
  connect to BeHappy backend servers (instead of MTProto 2.0 / Telegram
  DCs).
- Branding, visual identity, and product naming replaced throughout.
- Telegram-specific features removed where not applicable to BeHappy
  (e.g., Telegram Premium subscriptions, Telegram Stars, Fragment
  integration, sponsored messages).
- Additional features added that are unique to BeHappy.

The complete list of changes from upstream is tracked in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md). The upstream changelog is preserved in
[`UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.txt`](UPSTREAM_CHANGELOG.txt) for reference.
